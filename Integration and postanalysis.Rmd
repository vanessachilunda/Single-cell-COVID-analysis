#it does not seem that the sources of variation are per sample by looking at this figure

ElbowPlot(object = samples.integrated, ndims = 30)

#by looking at the previous plot it looks like the most significant PCs are around 10

#While this gives us a good rough idea of the number of PCs to include, a more quantitative approach may be a bit more reliable. 
#We will identify a PC threshold by calculating where the principal components start to elbow by taking the larger value of:
#The point where the principal components only contribute 5% of standard deviation and the principal components cumulatively contribute 90% of the standard deviation.
#The point where the percent change in variation between the consecutive PCs is less than 0.1%.

# Determine percent of variation associated with each PC
pct <- samples.integrated[["pca"]]@stdev / sum(samples.integrated[["pca"]]@stdev) * 100

# Calculate cumulative percents for each PC
cumu <- cumsum(pct)

# Determine which PC exhibits cumulative percent greater than 90% and % variation associated with the PC as less than 5
co1 <- which(cumu > 90 & pct < 5)[1]

co1

#The first metric returns PC43 as the PC matching these requirements. 
#Let’s check the second metric, which identifies the PC where the percent change in variation between consequtive PCs is less than 0.1%:

# Determine the difference between variation of PC and subsequent PC
co2 <- sort(which((pct[1:length(pct) - 1] - pct[2:length(pct)]) > 0.1), decreasing = T)[1] + 1

# last point where change of % of variation is more than 0.1%.

co2

#The second metric returned PC16. Now, to determine the selection of PCs, we will use the minimum of the two metrics:

# Minimum of the two calculation
pcs <- min(co1, co2)

pcs


#Based on these metrics, for the clustering of cells in Seurat we will use the first 8 PCs to generate the clusters. 
#We can plot the elbow plot again and overlay the information determined using our metrics

# Create a dataframe with values
plot_df <- data.frame(pct = pct, 
                      cumu = cumu, 
                      rank = 1:length(pct))

# Elbow plot to visualize

  geom_vline(xintercept = 90, color = "grey") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = min(pct[pct > 5]), color = "grey") +
  theme_bw()

#However, it’s often a good idea to check the genes associated with some higher PCs to make sure that other PCs shouldn’t be included 
#due to association with some rarer cell populations.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
